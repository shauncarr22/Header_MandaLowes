The cockpit has a gyroscopic control system allowing the pilot to always remain upright regardless of what the remainder of the fighter is doing.

Because of the need to place nearly all drive and lifesupport systems in the rear of the fighter, and the large amount of Proton torpedoes in its front section, the E-Wing looks a bit more stubby than the X-Wings sleek shape. 
If the pilot has to eject, the top of the cockpit is blow off and the pilot ejects out of the top of the fighter. Directly behind the pilot is a compartment wich holds the astromech droid. 
Unlike in the X-Wing, the astromech droid is completely located inside of the hull of the fighter, and as such is much less vulnerable. 
Behind the droid are the complex power systems and hyperdrive of the fighter. ");
